# epi-Genome scale cancer metabolic modeling

Objectives for this project:
- [ ] Identify specific reactions that contribute to histone methylation and demethylation
- [ ] Create genome-scale metabolic models and algorithms that can accurately capture histone mark specific behavior
- [ ] Develop new methods for using -omics data to predict drug sensitivity, variability
- [ ] Predict drugs that can be repurposed as demethylase/methylase inhibitors
- [ ] Predict drug combinations for various histone modifications
- [ ] Incorporate permissive actions of acetylation and DNA methylation
- [ ] Add other under-studied PTMs
- [ ] Add more acylation reactions
